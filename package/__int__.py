#   -> Packages - A package is a way to organize related modules(python files) together 

#     -> Module - A single .py file with some reuseable code

#     -> Package - A folder that contains multiple modules(python files)

#     -> Inside the folder, which you want to make as a package, we need to keep
#         a special file name __init__.py (can be empty -> start up configs can be kept)
