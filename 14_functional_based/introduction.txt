-> Functions

-> In python, function is a block of code that does 
    some TASK / ACTION

-> We use functions to get reuseable code, to avoid REPETITION

-> Breaking down complex/large tasks, into smaller manageable blocks 
    of tasks

-> function syntax

    def function_name():
        Statements

-> functions with parameters

    -> this type of functions, allow you to pass data to 
        function, when you call it
    
    -> Based on inputs, you can use different logics, 
    make code more dynamic and flexibility

    -> def arithmetic(a,b):
    print(a+b)

        # a & b -> parameters
        # 10 & 20 -> arguments

-> Python Supports different ways to pass arguments to functions

    -> Positional Arguments
    -> Keyword Arguments
    -> Default Arguments
    -> Variable Length Positional Arguments(*args)
    -> Variable Length Keyword Arguments(**kwargs)

-> Positional Arguments

    -> Pass arguments in the exact order, defined in function

    -> Position matters, like first argument goes to first parameter,
    second argument goes to second parameter and so on

==============

-> Default Arguments

    -> Passing default values to the arguments at function declaration

    -> If we pass any value to the default argument at function call,
        default value will be overridden by new value passed
    
    -> If no value is passed to default arguments, default values declared
        at function declaration will be considered

    -> Once you declare default parameters, next all consecutive parameters
    should be default only, not any other    

-> Keyword Arguments

    -> Arguments are passed by Explicitly specifying the name

    -> so function call is based on name of the arguments

    -> Improves code readability and also avoids confusion -> as order doesn't matter

    -> Once you declare Keyword parameters, next all consecutive parameters
    should be Keyword only, not any other    

    -> If the key is not found or proper key is not given, we get ERRORS

-> Variable / Arbitrary Positional Arguments(*args)

    -> Allows the functions to accept any number of Positional Arguments

    -> Used when we don't know how many arguments a function would receive

    -> Represented using *

    -> All the arguments passed are collected into a tuple 


-> Variable / Arbitrary Keyword Arguments(**kwargs)

    -> Allows the functions to accept any number of Keyword(Named) Arguments

    -> Used when we don't know how many arguments a function would receive

    -> Represented using **

    -> All the arguments passed are collected into a Dictionary

-> NOTE - We can use both Arbitrary Positional Arguments and
    Arbitrary Keyword Arguments together, good for Dynamic data inputs

-> Functions With Return Values

    -> Be default functions will not give any response

    -> To give response, use return keyword

    -> Always give appropriate response with return, as python is dynamic Typed
        can take any value
    
    -> Return Statement, should be the last Statement, in the function execution


-> Scopes in Functions

    -> Scope means how variable can be accessed based on where the variable is defined

    -> Local Scope

        -> A local variable is declared inside a function

        -> It only exists while the function runs

        -> You cannot use it outside the function

        -> NOTE: Earlier we have defined parameters, those are also local variables

    -> Global Scope

        -> A Global variable is declared outside a function

        -> It can be used anywhere in code, inside and outside function

        -> By default it is READ ONLY 

        -> If you want to change the value, then you need a keyword called global
