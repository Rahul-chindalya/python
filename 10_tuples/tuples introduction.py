#      -> Tuples - Tuples are also built in data structure, to store 
#           multiple items using a single variable, using parenthesis ()

#      -> NOTE - Tuples are IMMUTABLE (Cannot Change) 

#      -> Use Tuples, when you have READ ONLY Functionalities

#      -> Tuples have only TWO methods

#      -> index - returns index position
#             -> element is must
#             -> start is optional, default start is 0
#             -> end is optional, default end is end of list 
#         -> count - returns number of times an element is appeared
