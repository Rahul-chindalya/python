-> File Operations

    -> File operations in python allows for creating, reading, updating and deleting

    -> When working with data(persistent data), we want data to be stored 
        beyond programs execution
    
    -> Opening File (Working with existing files)

        -> 1st Approach using open function, and modes 
            -> r - read (reading data)
            -> w - write (will overwrite if file doesn't exist creates)
            -> a - append (add to existing)

        -> 2nd Approach using with open and modes    

    -> NOTE - 1st approach file will not close automatically
              2nd approach file will close automatically  

    
    -> Create a file
        -> Using open with write mode, creates a file
